perform integrity check on load: test for ! and checksum 
add checksum to save
- save/load full sysex?
- Does QDial support different mouse control modes? Personnally I am
  more used to the way the rotary knobs work in Logic - clicking on the
  button and sliding the mouse up and down rather than moving it in
  circle around the controller.

  keyboard shortcut like space or enter) to send some common MIDI
  messages, like note on C3 / note off / all sounds off?



DONE:
implement send_patch
fix fetch_patch: works only the first time -> mem alloc?
implement midi recieving
implement midi sending
