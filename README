Shruthi-Editor: An unofficial Editor for the Shruthi hardware synthesizer. For 
informations about the Shruthi, see <http://www.mutable-instruments.net/shruthi1>. 
Application icon: "saraswati" by Francois Barbut.

What works:
 - Editing patches.
 - Remotely changing patch options on the shruthi.
 - Loading/saving patches from/to disk.
 - Fetching/sending patches from/to the shruthi.
 - Changes made to patch options on the shruthi change the settings of the
   editor.
 - Generate random patches.


What doesn't work:
 - Automatic fetching/sending, e.g. on loading/saving.
 - Loading/saving full patch sysex.


Known bugs:
 - If you have a feedback loop (e.g. midi cable from active output to active
   input) and you change the input and the output device at the same time, the
   programm will crash. I don't know how to fix it. Reason: if you close a midi
   output, portmidi flushes the output buffer. If you close the input at the
   same time, portmidi will cause a segmentation fault on the next poll command.
   Workaround: change only   input oder output device at a time if you have a
   feedback loop.


Prerequisites:
 Qt4: http://qt.nokia.com/products/
 PortMidi: http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/


Compiling under windows (Prerequisites):
To compile it on windows, you need the mingw version of qt, mingw and portmidi.
You can download the first two archives from
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp.

Extract mingw first, then install qt. 

Extract portmidi and copy the file "portmidi.pro" from the pm_qt subfolder to
the portmidi folder. Edit "portmidi.pro" and change the line
CONFIG += staticlib # replace this with DLL for dynamic link on Windows
to
CONFIG += DLL # replace this with DLL for dynamic link on Windows
.Run 
> qmake 
and then 
> make release
.
Copy the "portmidi.h" from the pm_common subfolder and the file "portmidi.dll"
from the release subfolder into the shruthi-editor source folder. 


Compiling:
Run 
> qmake
> make release
inside the shruthi-editor source folder.


Changes:
v0.16 * support for dual VCF -> new ui layout
      * one minor bugfix
      * old ui layouts are currently broken (e.g. shruthi-editor-onepage.ui,
        shruthi-editor-tabs.ui)
